# ðŸ©º Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation in Breast-Cancer Care  
*(Task 3 â€” Kaggle Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset)*

A machine-learning workflow that classifies breast-cancer cases into **high, medium, or low priority** to help hospitals allocate diagnostic and treatment resources more effectively.

## Project Motivation
Hospitals often face bottlenecks when deciding which breast-cancer cases require immediate attention. By predicting **priority levels (high / medium / low)** from diagnostic measurements, clinicians can triage patients faster and deploy limited resources (e.g., biopsy slots, imaging time, oncologist review) where they matter most.

---

## Dataset
- **Name:** *Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)*  
- **Source:** Kaggle (`uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data`)  
- **Size:** 569 rows Ã— 32 columns (30 numeric features + labels)  
- **Features:** Mean, worst, and standard-error measurements of cell nucleus radius, perimeter, area, concavity, texture, etc.  
- **Label Engineering:**  
  - `high`  â†’ Malignant (`diagnosis == "M"`)  
  - `medium` â†’ Benign with radius above benign median  
  - `low`  â†’ Benign with radius below benign median

## Specific Objectives
1. **Data Understanding** â€“ load dataset, inspect distributions, flag quality issues.  
2. **Data Preparation** â€“ clean, encode 3-class priority, scale features.  
3. **Dataset Partitioning** â€“ stratified train/validation/test splits.  
4. **Model Development** â€“ train a *Random Forest* (baseline Logistic Reg. optional).  
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ report Accuracy & Macro F1, visualize confusion matrices.  
6. **Feature Interpretation** â€“ plot top feature importances.  
7. **Deployment-Readiness** â€“ notebook formatted with clear narrative & code.  
8. **Deliverables** â€“ annotated `.ipynb` + metrics summary for exec report.

## Methodology
| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Exploratory Analysis** | Checked distributions, class balance (benign â‰ˆ 63%, malignant â‰ˆ 37%), no missing values. |
| **Label Engineering** | Added `priority` column (`high / medium / low`) based on diagnosis and radius. |
| **Pre-processing** | Dropped *id* & unnamed column, applied `StandardScaler`. |
| **Model** | `RandomForestClassifier` (`class_weight="balanced"`, default hyper-params). |
| **Validation** | 80 / 20 stratified split; metrics computed on test set. |
| **Interpretability** | Used impurity-based feature importances (top 10 plotted). |

---

## Results
| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | **0.965** |
| **Macro F1-Score** | **0.965** |

**Class-wise performance**

| Priority | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|----------|-----------|--------|----|
| High     | 0.97 | 0.93 | 0.95 |
| Medium   | 0.95 | 0.97 | 0.96 |
| Low      | 0.97 | 1.00 | 0.99 |

**Top 5 predictive features**

1. `radius_mean`  
2. `area_worst`  
3. `perimeter_mean`  
4. `area_mean`  
5. `perimeter_worst`

> **Impact:** The model offers reliable, interpretable triage guidanceâ€”no low-priority cases were misclassified as high, reducing the risk of over-allocating scarce resources.
